City Traffic Data Warehouse
This repository holds the code and configuration for a scalable data warehouse designed to store and analyze vehicle trajectory data collected by swarm UAVs and static roadside cameras in a city traffic department. The data warehouse utilizes the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) framework with DBT, allowing analysts to define data transformations on-demand.
